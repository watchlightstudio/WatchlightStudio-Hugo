My name is Daniel.

I'm a solo developer operating out of the beautiful state of Oregon. I've lived here with my wife and golden retriever, Moose, for the last five years and have loved every minute of it, seasonal rain included. I consider myself a native of North Carolina, though I spent time passing through Connecticut for graduate school.

I'm classically trained as a chemist and am an engineer in my day job. Despite no formal education in coding, I'm self taught in C# and have dabbled with Python for machine learning (who hasn't). Fortunately, game engines like Unity and Godot are sufficiently forgiving nowadays that pretend-devs like me can still get by. It's a delight when scripts work on the first try (or the seventh...).

Art and personal expression are important to me. I'm not particularly good at drawing, painting, or the like (my pottery is especially horrible), but the discovery of digital art and *ctrl-Z* has been liberating. Anyone can be an artist, and I think that's awesome! For concept art, doodles, and quick design, Goodnotes and Procreate are my go-to choices. Aseprite and Blender are my preferred software for making game assets and fine tuning sprites. For everything else, Inkscape is my rock.

I'm a lifelong video game nut. My first handheld was the Gameboy Color (Pok√©mon Red) and the Gamecube was my first "real" console. Along the way, I've  grown attached to Xbox and Nintendo series devices. I'm a console boy through and through, though more out of loyalty than logic (PC master race is the obvious Spock pick). For some unknown reason, I'm a completionist on Xbox but don't have the same compulsion on Switch. Don't worry - I will not make you regret any achievements in my games. *I swear to never gate achievements behind multiple playthroughs.* See my video game tier list **here**.

Thanks for clicking on this site and for reading about me. If you're interested in following the development of this studio, please keep us bookmarked or check in occasionally! 

I hope that you'll return someday to play one of my games!




Cold room, heavy sheets, box fan - this is the way.
