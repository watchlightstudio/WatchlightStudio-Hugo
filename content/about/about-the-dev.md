## About the Dev
I'm a solo developer operating out of Oregon. I've lived here with my wife and dog for the last five years and have loved every minute of it, seasonal rain included.

I'm trained as a chemist and am an engineer in my day job. Par for the course, I started a company that doesn't match either of those roles... Although I'm not particularly proficient, I can manage in both C# and Python. Fortunately, game engines like Unity and Godot are sufficiently forgiving nowadays that pseudo-devs like me can still get by. It's still a delight and personal victory when scripts work on the first try.

Art and personal expression are important to me. I'm not particularly good at drawing, painting, or other "physical" art (my pottery is especially horrible), but the world of digital art and *ctrl-Z* is liberating. Anyone can be an artist, and I think that's awesome!

I'm a lifelong video game nut. My first handheld was the Gameboy Color (PokÃ©mon Red) and the Gamecube was my first console. Along the way, I've grown attached to Xbox and Nintendo devices. For some unknown reason, I'm an achievement completionist on Xbox but don't have the same compulsion on Switch. See my video game tier list **here**.

>Don't worry - I will not make you regret any achievements in my games. I swear to never gate achievements behind multiple playthroughs.

Thanks for visiting this site and for reading about me. If you're interested in following the development of this studio, please keep us bookmarked or check in occasionally! 

I hope that you'll return someday to play one of my games!
