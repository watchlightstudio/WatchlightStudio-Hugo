## About the Studio
Welcome to Watchlight.

Watchlight is a solo-dev studio that prioritizes independent game development, software for small dev teams and enthusiasts, and digital assets. We're passionate about games, creative expression, and enabling creators to "take the next step."

Above all else, we're a games-first studio. I'm a lifelong gamer and think that the hands-down, *best games* of late are almost always from independent studios and developers. In my opinion, the reason these games stand out is because the developers are passionate, creative, and undiluted. For the same reason, I do not believe in the AAA "design by committee" model, where creative ideas and visions are watered down to prioritize marketability and ROI/financial yield.

With Watchlight, I promise to make games that are undiluted, unvarnished, and that prioritize player experience. I adore video games, and I want to make games that connect with players in the best ways possible. It's important to me that Watchlight games adhere to a few core principles:

Player decisions are meaningful and add value to the game. There is no point hammering through low-value dialog or selecting decisions that all end up in the same place. Decision making should be a rewarding experience and the player should feel as though their choice matters. 

Combat is challenging but not unwieldy or punishing. I love *rewarding* games, not punishing ones. Players should be rewarded with a sense of achievement and should not fear skill-gating design.

The player's time is respected. Monotony for the sake of completion or progression devalues the experience and should not appear in a game. Grinding experience, materials, or items does not respect the player's time. Great games enable a player to grow, develop, and collect items in a way that prioritizes curiosity, exploration, and progression.

Storytelling doesn't hide from mature topics when the need arises. Life is hard, and it's OK to talk about things that are hard. Feel good games are important, but challenging themes and issues should not be whitewashed.

Make no mistake, this will be a long journey. I ask for your patience, especially as a part-time developer.

Watchlight will always be "games-first," but along the way I will be building and releasing tools to accelerate my own development. If you're looking for a catalyst for your team or own project, check them out! If you're just here for the games, keep an eye on the horizon.
