## Support the studio
You're amazing for visiting this site and clicking around! I'm so grateful to work on projects that I care about and that you might find cool too.  

If you want to support Watchlight, check out some of our recent projects and keep an eye on us!  

[Gumroad page](https://watchlightstudio.gumroad.com/)

If you're feeling frisky, buy one of our tools or games! Right now we're a little empty, so apologies for limited options...

### Donation and independent support
I'm fortunate to have a stable job outside of this passion project and can already make ends meet. If you're in the spirit of giving and still want to help the studio out, know that half of all independent contributions to Watchlight will be donated annually to [Oregon's Humane Society](https://www.oregonhumane.org/donate/).

### Patreon
Raw insight into Watchlight's current activities! I'll be posting weekly devlogs here, in case you have an interest and want to keep track of ongoings!
