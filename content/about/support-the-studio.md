### Don't get scammed
I'm fortunate to have a stable job outside of this passion project and can already make ends meet. I don't accept donations/independent contributions. I've claimed Watchlight handles on [Ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/watchlightstudio), [Buy Me a Coffee](buymeacoffee.com/watchlightstudio), and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/WatchlightStudio) to prevent squatters only. Please let me know if you find someone claiming to be me.
