## Studio Origins
Watchlight was borne from a passion for games and creative expression. During the day, I'm a full time engineer. All other hours, I'm an independent developer and creator.

>I build things, I make stuff, and I love games.

My "real" job is great, but my passion projects consume me. In a vacuum, I'd spend every hour of every day making stuff. The medium doesn't matter: physical and digital art, 3D printing, storytelling and worldbuilding, software development, woodworking, carpentry...I just like to make stuff, and I want to make games.

I'm starting Watchlight after years of unofficial game development. Inception started on yellow-pad paper in 2021, when I started outlining a game during a visit to my mother-in-law's. Several false starts between 2021-2023 led to forays in art & design, C#, and Unity exposure. Simple character controllers and designs littered these efforts. So did self doubt... "Who am I kidding, a game dev?"

And yet, I kept coming back for more. During quiet moments, weekends, and vacations, I kept practicing my art and started building more technical skills. At some point I started writing everything down and keeping track of my progress. Now, here we are.

>Founding Watchlight is my decision to "make it real."

It's a decision to formalize my passion for video games under my own creative brand and to bring great games to players. I'm not claiming to overhaul the space or innovate for the sake of transformation or propriety, but I do guarantee that these games will be products of passion and purpose. They'll be games that I want to play and hopefully games that you do too.

Thanks for visiting and for reading. I hope you'll come back one day to play one of my games.
