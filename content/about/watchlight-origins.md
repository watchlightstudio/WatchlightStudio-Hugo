This studio was borne from a passion for games and creative expression.

My name is Daniel, and I'm the creator of Watchlight. During the day, I'm a full time engineer. All other hours, I'm an independent developer and creator. I build things. I make stuff. I play games.

I love my job, but not enough to do it forever. Call it a mid-life crisis, but I've started to realize that life's too short to pretend that I don't want something different. My passion projects, however, consume me. In a vacuum, I'd spend every hour of forever making stuff. Physical and digital art, storytelling and worldbuilding, software development and design, woodworking and carpentry... And, I cannot stress this enough, *games.*

I'm starting Watchlight after years of "unofficial" game development. Inception started on yellow-pad paper in 2021, when I started doodling out my perfect game during a visit to my mother-in-law's house. Several false starts between 2021-2023 led to forays in art & design, C#, and Unity exposure. Simple character controllers and designs littered these efforts, and self-limiting reality checks led me to ask: "A game dev? Who am I kidding?" Since then, however, I realized that I cannot shake the itch. No matter how hard I try, I find myself coming back for more. Since 2023, more substantial development has led me to polish both artistic and technical skills, and my internal compass has clearly put me on a path.

Founding Watchlight is my decision to "make it real." It's a decision to formalize my passion for video games under my own creative brand and to bring great games to players. I'm not claiming to overhaul the space or innovate for the sake of transformation or propriety, but I do guarantee that these games will be products of passion and purpose. They'll be games that I want to play and hopefully games that you do too.

Thanks for visiting and for reading. Please excuse the mess.
