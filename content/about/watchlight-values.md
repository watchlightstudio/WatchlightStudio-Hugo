Watchlight Studio is an independent developer project and is proud to represent a few core values.

### On diversity and personal expression:
Gaming is a joy to so many. For me, it is an outlet for creativity and achievement. For others, it can be an escape or a relief from reality, a place to form friendships or to bond, a challenge or a brain game, a simulator or an adventure, a space for artists or thrill seekers... The list goes on. Everyone should be entitled to play their own way. For the same reason, Watchlight enthusiastically supports diversity and personal expression. We are friends to all races, nationalities, religions, sexual orientations and identifications. Games are personal and unique - and so are you!

### On tolerance:
Watchlight will never marginalize it's players nor tolerate such behavior. Hate speech and bigotry are not tolerated on our common forums, and users that violate this requirement will be removed.
