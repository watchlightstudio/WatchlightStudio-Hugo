## Environmental Asset Creation & Game Design

### Overview
During the last two weeks, I continued focusing on environmental asset creation in Blender and game design, with a renewed emphasis on overcoming creative roadblocks. Key goals included refining existing assets, exploring new techniques for diverse landscapes, and improving workflow efficiency.

### Highlights & Progress
#### Art & Visuals
- Refined rocky cliff assets using a combination of non-grid-based geometry and detailed textures for a more organic appearance
- Implemented procedural shorelines using Blender's built-in add-ons like AutoTerrain
- Began work on forest environments, experimenting with various tree styles, branch variations, and foliage types
- Optimized grass rendering by implementing a more efficient approach to rotation angles and reducing shadow casting
- Continued improving cobblestone textures and natural rock placement for varied terrain
#### Systems & Mechanics
- Further developed the probability index system for enemy movesets based on player progress, including adjustments for randomness and strategic encounters
- Integrated basic resource systems, such as health potions and ammunition, with a focus on making resources scarce yet manageable
- Continued scaling bosses based on an arbitrary heuristic to ensure fair fights for players around the right level
#### Workflow Improvements
- Made significant progress in addressing creative roadblocks by adopting new asset creation techniques and strategies
- Optimized workflow through better organization, prioritization of tasks, and time management practices
- Began researching new hardware options to further improve Blender performance and longevity
### Reflections
- Overcoming creative roadblocks required a mix of patience, experimentation, and persistence
- Procedural shorelines have added variety to the game's environments while streamlining asset creation
- Resource systems are beginning to create a sense of urgency and challenge for players
- Adopting more efficient workflows has improved productivity and reduced stress
- Hardware upgrades will be essential for continued progress in both asset creation and performance optimization
### Next Steps
- Finalize forest environments, including tree designs, foliage types, and varied terrain features
- Integrate enemy AI to create engaging encounters within diverse landscapes
- Balance resource scarcity and player progression to maintain an appropriate level of challenge
- Further optimize grass rendering for improved performance and visual appeal
- Implement procedural cave generation using AutoTerrain or alternative solutions
