## Echo App Development & Studio Projects

### Overview
The main focus of this month was enhancing user experience and functionality within the Echo app. New functions were added to increase app accessibility and value to non-developers, including access to OpenAI, Notion, and Obsidian.

### Highlights & Progress

- **User Experience**: Refactored menus to improve readability and navigation. Implemented an Easter egg for added fun.
- **Systems & Mechanics**: Improved the cost savings calculator by measuring tokenization rate using Ollama. Created a local transcription script for measuring transcription speed more accurately. Added an inline transcription speed check using Faster Whisper.
- **Workflow Improvements**: Streamlined tray app interface and conducted final checks for potential threading issues. Added a configuration check script to enable or disable menus based on settings. Enhanced logging, user prompting, GUIs, redundancy, and error handling within Echo.

### Reflections
- **What worked well**: The tray app refactoring made navigation easier, and adding a cost savings calculator resulted in more accurate estimates for users.
- **What didn't work well**:  Threading issues and ensuring smooth operation will require further attention.
- **What surprised me**: Implementing legal disclosure forms slowed down my progress towards core app features, but I realized it's value to maintain transparency with users and defend the LLC.
- **What changed in terms of approach or mindset**: Echo app release needs to be prioritized so that I can return to core game development.

### Next Steps
- **Deployment readiness**: Finalize setup scripts, take snapshots, and videos for Echo app deployment. Investigate Linux compatibility for Echo app.
- **Open PRs**: Resolve the background threading issue causing errors in command lines. Continue refactoring and improving features within Echo, such as dark mode and user control over formatted output markdown files.
