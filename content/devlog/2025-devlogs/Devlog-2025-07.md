## Echo App Development & Studio Projects

### Overview
During July 2025, I focused on refining the Echo app while exploring potential improvements for our studio projects. The main focus of this month was enhancing user experience and functionality within the Echo app, along with investigating new features like an Easter egg and torque feedback for our electroplating tool.

### Highlights & Progress

#### Art & Visuals
- Refactored menus to improve readability and navigation
- Implemented an Easter egg feature for added fun

#### Systems & Mechanics
- Improved the cost savings calculator by measuring tokenization rate using Ollama
- Created a local transcription script for measuring transcription speed more accurately
- Added an inline transcription speed check using Faster Whisper
- Made significant improvements to the electroplating tool, including implementing torque feedback

#### Workflow Improvements
- Streamlined GBT base tray app interface and conducted final checks for potential threading issues
- Added a configuration check script to enable or disable menus based on settings
- Enhanced logging, user prompting, GUIs, redundancy, and error handling within Echo

### Reflections
- The cost savings calculator improvements resulted in more accurate estimations for users, but additional security barriers are still needed to prevent unauthorized access.
- Implementing the Easter egg feature added a fun touch to the app and increased user engagement.
- Working on the electroplating tool's torque feedback was a promising step towards reducing labor costs and creating a no-service required fab.
- The GBT base tray app refactoring made navigation easier, but addressing threading issues and ensuring smooth operation will require further attention.
- Implementing legal disclosure forms slowed down my progress on other projects, but it's essential to maintain transparency with users.

### Next Steps
- Finalize setup scripts, take snapshots, and videos for Echo app deployment
- Resolve the background threading issue causing errors in command lines
- Continue refactoring and improving features within Echo, such as dark mode and user control over formatted output markdown files
- Gather feedback on the potential student mode for Echo from John's students
- Investigate Linux compatibility for Echo app
- Work on implementing additional smart device features for our equipment
- Complete my two-week trip to Taiwan, making progress on Echo and studio projects where possible
