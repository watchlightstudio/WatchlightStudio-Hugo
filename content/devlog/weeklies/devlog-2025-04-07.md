# Weekly Devlog: Exploring AI for Productivity Enhancement

## Key Topics
- Text-to-Speech and Transcription in Game Development
- AI for Patent Drafting
- Conversational AI during Downtime
## Published Summary
This week, I explored the potential of local Language Model Models (LLMs) to enhance my productivity across both personal and professional projects. Initially, I started experimenting with Whisper for text-to-speech conversion in game development, particularly for world building, character development, and storyline narration during idle moments. However, the potential applications quickly expanded to patent drafting and utilizing a conversational AI agent during downtime (e.g., driving or breaks).

For the game development project, I pondered over integrating an Ollama model for generating notes from recordings. If successful, this tool could optimize my workflow and boost creativity. In an ambitious extension, I considered a third functionality that would enable human-like conversations with another local LLM model.

Regarding patent drafting, I envisioned utilizing AI to streamline the process and make it more efficient during downtime. The conversational AI agent would aid in crafting claims, asking pertinent questions about the scope of work, and providing suggestions for better organization. However, I'm aware that these new functions might impact my workflow and productivity differently across various domains, and I remain uncertain about their effectiveness and quality.

## Action Items
- Download and test Whisper model using Ollama for text-to-speech conversion in game development
- Investigate potential models like Mistral or Mixtral for patent drafting
- Research application of conversational AI during downtime
- Test a prototype and evaluate its effectiveness based on feedback received
## Questions Raised
- Will the models generate useful notes from recordings in game development?
- Can I create a conversation with another local LLM model for better productivity?
- How will these new functions impact my workflow and productivity across different domains (e.g., game development, patent drafting)?
- Does conversational AI possess the capacity to grasp the intricacies of a patent claim?
- Can AI adapt seamlessly to varying patent filing requirements across jurisdictions?
- Will the quality of patents suffer if they are drafted using an AI tool?
