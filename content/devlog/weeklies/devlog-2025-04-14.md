# Weekly Devlog: Transcription Project Progress and Future Directions
#devlog

## Key Topics
- Integrating LMM into transcription workflow
- Script for handling token limits
- Semi-automatic system development
- Helper bot packaging
- Tagging and backlinking in Obsidian
## Published Summary

The past week saw significant progress on my audio transcription project, which now utilizes the Faster-Whisper model. I tackled the challenge of integrating a large language model (LMM) into this workflow to enhance information retrieval. However, I anticipate dealing with token limits when transcribing multiple long audio files. To address this issue, I'll be writing a script that combines shorter transcripts into larger chunks based on their original audio file lengths.

In addition to this, I aimed to create a semi-automatic system for processing multiple transcriptions over time. My goal is to package the project as a helper bot for educational purposes in the future. I made progress on implementing tags and backlinks within Obsidian for better organization but acknowledged the difficulty in creating an automatic tagging and backlinking system that works consistently across various contexts.

As the week unfolded, I reflected on potential challenges ahead: ensuring the LMM is efficient with large audio files, refining its output style for specific domains like journalism or game development, and determining the ideal educational settings for my helper bot. While these issues remain unresolved, I share regular updates in my devlog to maintain transparency and gather insights from the developer community.

## Action Items
- Write script to combine shorter transcripts into larger chunks based on original audio file lengths.
- Create semi-automatic system to process multiple transcripts over a given time period (e.g., based on timestamps or manual selection)
- Package the project as a helper bot for educational purposes
- Develop a solution to automatically identify and apply relevant tags and backlinks based on transcribed text
- Test the effectiveness of the implemented features by working with different use cases and data sets
## Questions Raised
- Will the LMM be able to handle large audio files efficiently?
- How can I ensure that the LMM's output is refined and suitable for specific styles like journalism or game development?
- What educational settings would benefit most from a helper bot that transcribes lectures or meetings?
- What is the best approach for identifying and applying consistent tags across various contexts?
- How can I optimize my script to seamlessly connect related notes using backlinks within Obsidian?
