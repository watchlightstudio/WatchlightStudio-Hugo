## Who Nucleate _Is Not_ Built For

Nucleate is designed for people who want their audio turned into structured knowledge with minimal friction. If that’s not your workflow, it may not be the right tool for you.
**Nucleate may not be a good fit if you:**
- Want a live meeting assistant that joins Zoom or Teams calls    
- Expect real-time transcripts or live captions    
- Prefer editing audio directly (cutting, rearranging, polishing recordings)    
- Want a chat-style AI that you actively prompt for every task    
- Are looking for a purely cloud-based SaaS with no local setup    
- Don’t want to work with files, folders, or Markdown output    
- Expect one-click results without understanding performance tradeoffs    

Nucleate favors **automation, ownership, and long-term clarity** over interactivity and polish.

## Who Nucleate _Is_ Built For

Nucleate _is_ a good fit if you:
- Think out loud and record frequently    
- Want notes that organize themselves over time    
- Care about file ownership, privacy, and local-first workflows    
- Use Markdown, Obsidian, or Notion    
- Prefer tools that work quietly in the background    
- Are comfortable tuning settings once and letting things run    

If you’ve ever wished your audio notes turned into usable project history without constant babysitting, Nucleate was built for you.

## How Nucleate Compares
Nucleate is not a meeting recorder or a writing assistant — it’s an autonomous note engine.  
Unlike tools like Otter or Descript, it runs locally, works offline, and is designed for long, unstructured audio such as dev logs, research notes, lectures, and journaling. And unlike Notion AI, it doesn’t live inside a document editor or lock you into a single platform.

Nucleate watches your files, processes them in the background, and produces structured Markdown that you fully control.

Nucleate solves a different problem than most transcription tools. The comparison below highlights **architectural and workflow differences**, not quality judgments.

Otter, Descript, and Notion AI are excellent at what they’re built for. Nucleate is built for people who think out loud and want their ideas quietly organized over time.
