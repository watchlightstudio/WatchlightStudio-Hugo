## Make it Yours
Once Nucleate is set up, it works quietly in the background — but there’s a lot of depth available if you want it.

This section explains day-to-day usage, menus, automation toggles, and customization options. Whether you want a hands-off experience or a finely tuned workflow, these pages help you shape Nucleate to fit how you think and work.
