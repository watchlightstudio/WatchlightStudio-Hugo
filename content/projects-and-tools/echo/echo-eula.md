## END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
Effective Date: 2025-07-01

This End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you ("User") and Watchlight Studio LLC ("Developer") for the use of the software product Echo ("Software").

1. GRANT OF LICENSE  
You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to download, install, and use one copy of the Software on devices owned or controlled by you for personal or internal business use.
	You may not, without prior written consent:  
	- Resell, redistribute, sublicense, or commercially exploit the Software.  
	- Modify, reverse engineer, or decompile the Software.  
	- Use the Software to develop or train competing products.

2. OWNERSHIP  
This is a license, not a sale. The Software is licensed, not sold, and all rights, title, and interest in and to the Software remain with the Developer.

3. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY  
The Software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The Developer makes no guarantees regarding the accuracy, reliability, or fitness for any particular purpose of any transcriptions, summaries, or other content generated by the Software. Content generated by third-party models (e.g. Ollama) is not reviewed or controlled by the Developer. Use of the Software is at your own risk.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY  
In no event shall the Developer be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the Software, including but not limited to loss of data, inaccurate output, or unintended exposure of sensitive information.

5. PRIVACY  
	5.1 Data defaults  
	Echo processes data locally on your device. The Software does not collect or transmit any personal data by default. However, if you configure optional third-party integrations (such as the OpenAI API or Notion API), you are solely responsible for reviewing and complying with the terms and privacy policies of those services.

	5.2 API key notice  
	The keys for services such as OpenAI or Notion are stored locally in unencrypted configuration files. The Developer does not access, collect, or transmit these keys.

6. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND SOFTWARE  
	6.1 NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit  
	The Software optionally utilizes the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for GPU acceleration. CUDA is proprietary software owned by NVIDIA Corporation. The CUDA Toolkit must be installed separately by the user, and its use is subject to NVIDIAâ€™s license agreements and terms available at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit.

	6.2 External APIs and Services  
	The Software supports integration with third-party services such as OpenAI, Notion, and Obsidian. Use of these services requires separate user accounts and acceptance of their respective terms of service and privacy policies. The Developer is not responsible for these third-party terms or any data transmitted to or from such services.

	6.3 User Responsibility  
	You are solely responsible for compliance with all third-party service terms, including appropriate handling of API keys and data privacy.

	6.4 Model and Dependency Licensing  
	The Software may interact with or download open-source or third-party machine learning models (e.g., Mistral via Ollama) and dependencies (e.g., faster-whisper, CTranslate2) that are governed by their own licenses. These components are not developed or maintained by the Developer and may impose restrictions on use, including limitations on commercial use.

	The Developer does not redistribute any proprietary models or weights directly. When enabling automatic model downloads, you are responsible for reviewing and complying with the licenses and terms of any external models, libraries, or services accessed or installed through the Software.

	Examples include but are not limited to:  
	- Mistral models via Ollama, subject to Ollama's license terms (https://ollama.com)  
	- CUDA Toolkit by NVIDIA (see Section 6.1)  
	- APIs and models by OpenAI, Notion, Hugging Face, and others

	Use of these third-party components is at your own risk. You agree that the Developer is not liable for any claims or consequences arising from your use of externally licensed models or services.
	
	6.6 Recommendations for Third-Party Applications
	From time to time, the Developer may suggest or recommend third-party applications, services, or integrations that may work with the Software. These recommendations are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute an endorsement, guarantee, or warranty of any kind.

	The Developer does not test, monitor, or control the operation, security, or content of these third-party applications. Use of any recommended third-party application is at your sole discretion and risk. You are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to the applicable terms of service, privacy policy, and license agreements for any third-party application you choose to use.

	The Developer shall not be liable for any damages, loss of data, or issues arising from your use of any recommended third-party application.

7. UPDATES AND SUPPORT  
The Developer may release updates at their sole discretion. This Agreement does not obligate the Developer to provide ongoing support, updates, or bug fixes.

8. REFUND POLICY  
	All sales of the Echo software are final. Due to the digital nature of the product and the immediate access granted upon purchase, Watchlight Studio LLC does not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges.

	By purchasing this software, you acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to a refund for any reason, including but not limited to dissatisfaction with the features, bugs, or changes in your system compatibility.

	If you experience technical issues, support is available via the channels listed on the official website.

9. TERMINATION  
This Agreement is effective until terminated. It will automatically terminate if you breach any term of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy any copies in your possession.

10. GOVERNING LAW  
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Oregon, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

By installing, copying, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
